# TS-Lox

This is a typescript implementation of the Lox language from the book ["Crafting interpreters"](http://craftinginterpreters.com) by Robery Nystrom. This is a work in progress with a lot of work to do, published as a learning exercise.

## TODO

- [ ] Use typescript library to generate the parser with ASTs instead of naked strings
